# Northcoders News API

## Background

Created as the back end project of my coding boot camp with Northcoders, this API has been built to then use with my front end block of the course. The final project will be a mini Reddit style news forum.

It is a PSQL database which you can visit here: [https://be-nc-news-4vle.onrender.com/api](https://be-nc-news-4vle.onrender.com/api)
## Getting started

### Cloning

To get started with the API, just clone the repository to your desired location and then navigate into the cloned folder.

### Install dependancies

Once in the folder, run the following code to ensure all dependencies are installed :

`npm install`

### Seeding and .env Files

To access the correct databases locally, create the below 2 env files and save them within the root directory:

`.env.development set to PGDATABASE=nc_news`

and

`.env.test set to PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

To seed the databases, then run

`sudo service postgresql start` and `npm run seed`

## Testing

Tests for the project are created using jest and all tests out comes can be viewed by running

`npm test`

## Minimum Versions of Technologies

Node.js version `v16.0.0`

PostgreSQL version `v12.9`
